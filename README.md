# brain-machine-interface-neural-decoder
Neural Decoder Coursework as part of Brain Machine Interface Module taught by Dr. Claudia Clopath at Imperial College London

The goal of this project was to process neural data and create a neural decoder that can predict the arm movement position for any give neural spike train.

Different statistical and machine learning where tested and the final pipeline implemented PCA, LDA, K-NN angle predictor and linear regression.
